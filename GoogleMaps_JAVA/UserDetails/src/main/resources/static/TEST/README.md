HOW TO RUN
-------------

1. Install bower depencies by command ---> bower install
2. Run  index.html;



DETAILS OF CONTENT
----------------------

I have created a simple Angular client side folder scructure.

For content you can go through these 3 files 
1. for View -->  index.html
2. for controller --> controllers.js
3. for custom CSS -->  style.css 


All dependencies are installed through bower so all libraries are there.

ng-table libraries are in lib folder.
